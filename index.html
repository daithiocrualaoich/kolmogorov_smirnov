<h2>Kolmogorov-Smirnov Hypothesis Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#kolmogorov-smirnov-hypothesis-testing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is a hypothesis test procedure for determining if
two samples of data are from the same distribution. The test is non-parametric
and entirely agnostic to what this distribution actually is. The fact that we
never have to know the distribution the samples come from is incredibly useful,
especially in software and operations where the distributions are hard to
express and difficult to calculate with.</p>
<p>It is really surprising that such a useful test exists. This is an unkind
Universe, we should be completely on our own.</p>
<p>The test description may look a bit hard in the outline below but skip ahead to
the implementation because the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is incredibly easy in
practice.</p>
<p>The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is covered in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.aip.de/groups/soe/local/numres">Numerical Recipes</a>. There is a
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.aip.de/groups/soe/local/numres/bookcpdf/c14-3.pdf">pdf</a> available
from the third edition of Numerical Recipes in C.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test">Wikipedia article</a>
is a useful overview but light about proof details. If you are interested in
why the test statistic has a distribution that is independent and useful for
constructing the test then these
<a class="reference external" href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-443-statistics-for-applications-fall-2006/lecture-notes/lecture14.pdf">MIT lecture notes</a>
give a sketch overview.</p>
<p>See this <a class="reference external" href="https://vimeo.com/95069158">introductory talk</a> by Toufic Boubez at
Monitorama for an application of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to metrics and
monitoring in software operations. The slides are available on

<div class="section" id="the-test-statistic">
<h3>The Test Statistic<a class="headerlink" href="#the-test-statistic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is constructed as a statistical hypothesis test. We
determine a null hypothesis, <img class="math" src="_images/math/db2c44abe31cf800b185da896a5432387d8f401d.png" alt="H_0"/>, that the two samples we are testing
come from the same distribution. Then we search for evidence that this
hypothesis should be rejected and express this in terms of a probability. If
the likelihood of the samples being from different distributions exceeds a
confidence level we demand the original hypothesis is rejected in favour of the
hypothesis, <img class="math" src="_images/math/21cc7040dca8c66724474b79619e9d87a4b496c8.png" alt="H_1"/>, that the two samples are from different distributions.</p>
<p>To do this we devise a single number calculated from the samples, i.e. a
statistic. The trick is to find a statistic which has a range of values that do
not depend on things we do not know. Like the actual underlying distributions in
this case.</p>
<p>The test statistic in the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is very easy, it is just the
maximum vertical distance between the empirical cumulative distribution
functions of the two samples. The empirical cumulative distribution of a sample
is the proportion of the sample values that are less than or equal to a given
value.</p>
<p>For instance, in this plot of the empirical cumulative distribution functions
of normally distributed data, <img class="math" src="_images/math/b1dfe2cac3b8c2bf96e4d4dce66afe9aef4dda03.png" alt="N(0, 1)"/> and <img class="math" src="_images/math/feefe80143b5bee7f381a2d00ad37e9fc58be311.png" alt="N(0, 2)"/> samples, the
maximum vertical distance between the lines is at about -1.5 and 1.5.</p>
<img alt="_images/n01n02ecdf-1.png" src="_images/n01n02ecdf-1.png" />
<p>The vertical distance is a lot clearer for an <img class="math" src="_images/math/b1dfe2cac3b8c2bf96e4d4dce66afe9aef4dda03.png" alt="N(0, 1)"/> sample against
<img class="math" src="_images/math/bff727432da2201266a2d65bb3517a401c9ffa7b.png" alt="N(1, 1)"/>. The maximum vertical distance occurs somewhere around zero and
is quite large, maybe about 0.35 in size. This is significant evidence that the
two samples are from different distributions.</p>
<img alt="_images/n01n11ecdf-1.png" src="_images/n01n11ecdf-1.png" />
<p>As an aside, these examples demonstrate an important note about the application
of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. It is much better at detecting distributional
differences when the sample medians are far apart than it is at detecting
when the tails are different but the main mass of the distributions is around
the same values.</p>
<p>So, more formally, suppose <img class="math" src="_images/math/052fd265afd6d56a7143b0bcf7232e2d86f2dc7e.png" alt="X_i"/> are n independent and identically
distributed observations of a continuous value. The empirical cumulative
distribution function, <img class="math" src="_images/math/bacdaf2f979238c05ec1690cd4777be7056b07d7.png" alt="F_n"/>, is:</p>
<div class="math">
<p><img src="_images/math/fa8efad541845aeb3a36cade8cee92dd96075140.png" alt="F_n(x) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n I_{(-\infty,x]}(X_i)"/></p>
</div><p>Where <img class="math" src="_images/math/5d9e7b2aec3287330051a115f2ea3cdc8c7a6587.png" alt="I"/> is the indicator function which is 1 if <img class="math" src="_images/math/052fd265afd6d56a7143b0bcf7232e2d86f2dc7e.png" alt="X_i"/> is less than
or equal to <img class="math" src="_images/math/188c175aac0a8a9c22499336711b5d7256407254.png" alt="x"/> and 0 otherwise.</p>
<p>This just says that <img class="math" src="_images/math/de3358b0714efa74a67864b62923f596e6fa2523.png" alt="F_n(x)"/> is the number of samples observed that are
less than or equal to <img class="math" src="_images/math/188c175aac0a8a9c22499336711b5d7256407254.png" alt="x"/> divided by the total number of samples. But it
says it in a complicated way so we can feel clever about ourselves.</p>
<p>The empirical cumulative distribution function is an unbiased estimator for the
underlying cumulative distribution function, incidentally.</p>
<p>For two samples having empirical cumulative distribution functions
<img class="math" src="_images/math/de3358b0714efa74a67864b62923f596e6fa2523.png" alt="F_n(x)"/> and <img class="math" src="_images/math/da8cc3c48d781486aa839c010e008d46e65ed190.png" alt="G_m(x)"/>, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic,
<img class="math" src="_images/math/9dfa31437b58c0473299320aa638151cd88cf61b.png" alt="D"/>, is the maximum absolute difference between <img class="math" src="_images/math/de3358b0714efa74a67864b62923f596e6fa2523.png" alt="F_n(x)"/> and

between the plots in the graph.</p>
<div class="math">

</div><p>The Glivenko–Cantelli theorem says if the <img class="math" src="_images/math/de3358b0714efa74a67864b62923f596e6fa2523.png" alt="F_n(x)"/> is made from samples
from the same distribution as <img class="math" src="_images/math/da8cc3c48d781486aa839c010e008d46e65ed190.png" alt="G_m(x)"/> then this statistic &#8220;almost surely
converges to zero in the limit when n goes to infinity.&#8221; This is an extremely
technical statement that we are simply going to ignore.</p>

<h3>Two Sample Test<a class="headerlink" href="#two-sample-test" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Surprisingly, the distribution of <img class="math" src="_images/math/9dfa31437b58c0473299320aa638151cd88cf61b.png" alt="D"/> can be approximated well in the case
that the samples are drawn from the same distribution. This means we can build
a statistic test that rejects this null hypothesis for a given confidence level
if <img class="math" src="_images/math/9dfa31437b58c0473299320aa638151cd88cf61b.png" alt="D"/> exceeds an easily calculable value.</p>
<p>Tables of critical values are available, for instance the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.webdepot.umontreal.ca/Usagers/angers/MonDepotPublic/STT3500H10/Critical_KS.pdf">SOEST tables</a>
describe a test implementation for samples of more than twelve where we reject
the null hypothesis, i.e. decide that the samples are from different
distributions, if:</p>
<div class="math">
<p><img src="_images/math/82b7375dd61c12ab6cc343e8be1c23eac3fd4ef1.png" alt="D &gt; c(\alpha)\sqrt{\frac{n + m}{n m}}"/></p>
</div><p>Where n and m are the sample sizes. A 95% confidence level corresponds to
<img class="math" src="_images/math/5e19daa1eb7bd77ebe60c0546b1a2304d235cb7f.png" alt="\alpha = 0.05"/> for which <img class="math" src="_images/math/9e58a9e0b0cce2f132f46ec7957d5ea07c02101d.png" alt="c(\alpha) = 1.36"/>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, Numerical Recipes describes a direct calculation that works well
for:</p>
<div class="math">
<p><img src="_images/math/2667f7baa93a4219c03d9d46f527a682d3d8b1ff.png" alt="N_{n, m} = \frac{n m}{n + m} \geq 4"/></p>
</div><p>i.e. for samples of more than seven since <img class="math" src="_images/math/176e0ba8d66853e26b9bcfbeed571ff39d8f07d6.png" alt="N_{8, 8} = 4"/>.</p>
<p>Numerical Recipes continues by claiming the probability that the test statistic
is greater than the value observed is approximately:</p>
<div class="math">
<p><img src="_images/math/650b24b8ef315acfdd6eeca0ab02d81cceed9db7.png" alt="P(D &gt; \text{observed}) = Q_{KS}\Big(\Big[\sqrt{N_{n, m}} + 0.12 + 0.11/\sqrt{N_{n, m}}\Big] D\Big)"/></p>
</div><p>With <img class="math" src="_images/math/fcb41f2b9e9b45934eb731105cb0fd65b8c88183.png" alt="Q_{KS}"/> defined as:</p>
<div class="math">
<p><img src="_images/math/71db49269aa6b2f877fa5f30aa47fc2d54948e88.png" alt="Q_{KS}(x) = 2 \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{j-1} e^{-2j^2x^2}"/></p>
</div><p>This can be computed by summing terms until a convergence criterion is achieved.
The implementation in Numerical Recipes gives this a hundred terms to converge
before failing.</p>
<p>The difference between the two approximations is marginal. The Numerical
Recipes approach produces slightly smaller critical values for rejecting the
null hypothesis as can be seen in the following plot of critical values for the
95% confidence level where one of the samples has size 256. The x axis varies
over the other sample size, the y axis being the critical value.</p>
<img alt="_images/critical-values-1.png" src="_images/critical-values-1.png" />
<p>The SOEST tables are an excellent simplifying approximation.</p>

<div class="section" id="discussion">
<h3>Discussion<a class="headerlink" href="#discussion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A straightforward implementation of this test can be found in the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/daithiocrualaoich/kolmogorov_smirnov">Github repository</a>.
Calculating the test statistic using the empirical cumulative distribution
functions is probably as complicated as it gets for this. There are two versions
of the test statistic calculation in the code, the simpler version being used to
probabilistically verify the more efficient implementation.</p>
<p>Non-parametricity and generality are the great advantages of the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test but these are balanced by drawbacks in ability to
establish sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.</p>
<p>In particular, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is weak in cases when the sample
empirical cumulative distribution functions do not deviate strongly even though
the samples are from different distributions. For instance, the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is most sensitive to discrepency near the median of the
samples because this is where differences in the graph are most likely to be
large. It is less strong near the tails because the cumulative distribution
functions will both be near 0 or 1 and the difference between them less
pronounced. Location and shape related scenarios that constrain the <img class="math" src="_images/math/9dfa31437b58c0473299320aa638151cd88cf61b.png" alt="D"/>
test statistic reduce the ability of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to correctly
reject the null hypothesis.</p>
<p>The Chi-squared test is also used for testing whether samples are from the same
distribution but this is done with a binning discretization of the data. The
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test does not require this.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> is a Mozilla sponsored project to create a safe, fast systems language.
There is an entire free

on why create this new language but the reasons include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Robust memory management. It is impossible to deference null or dangling
pointers in Rust.</li>
<li>Improved security, reducing the incidence of flaws like buffer overflow
exploits.</li>
<li>A light runtime with no garbage collection and overhead means Rust is
ideal to embed in other languages and platforms like Ruby, Python, and Node.</li>
<li>Rust has many modern language features unavailable in other systems languages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rust is a serious language, capable of very serious projects. The current
flagship Rust project, for instance, is <a class="reference external" href="https://servo.org">Servo</a>, a browser engine under open
source development with contributions from Mozilla and Samsung.</p>
<p>The best introduction to Rust is the <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book">Rust Book</a>. Newcomers should also read
Steve Klabnik&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="http://words.steveklabnik.com/a-new-introduction-to-rust">alternative introduction to Rust</a> for the upfront no-nonsense

<h3>Moral Support for Learning the Memory Rules<a class="headerlink" href="#moral-support-for-learning-the-memory-rules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Road to Rust is not royal, there is no pretending otherwise. The Rust memory
rules about lifetime, ownership, and borrowing are especially hard to learn.</p>
<p>It probably doesn&#8217;t much feel like it but Rust is really trying to help us with
these rules. And to be fair to Rust, it hasn&#8217;t segfaulted me so far.</p>
<p>But that is no comfort when the compiler won&#8217;t build your code and you can&#8217;t
figure out why. The best advice is probably to read as much about the Rust
memory rules as you can and to keep reading about them over and over until they
start to make some sense. Don&#8217;t worry, everybody finds it difficult at first.</p>
<p>Although adherence to the rules provides the compiler with invariant guarantees
that can be used to construct proofs of memory safety, the rationale for these
rules is largely unimportant. What is necessary is to find a way to work with
them so your programs compile.</p>
<p>Remember too that learning to manage memory safely in C/C++ is much harder than
learning Rust and there is no compiler checking up on you in C/C++ to make sure
your memory management is correct.</p>
<p>Keep at it. It takes a long time but it does become clearer!</p>

<p>This section is a scattering of Rust arcana that caught my attention. Nothing
here that doesn&#8217;t interest you is worth troubling too much with and you should
skip on past.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a> has excellent support for building Rust projects, including with

<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">travis.yml</span></code> according to the
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/rust">Travis Rust documentation</a>.
See the <a class="reference external" href="https://travis-ci.org/daithiocrualaoich/kolmogorov_smirnov">Travis CI build for this project</a> for an example.</p>
<p>Rust has a formatter in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt">rustfmt</a> and a lint in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy">rust-clippy</a>. The formatter
is a simple install using <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cargo</span> <span class="pre">install</span></code> and provides a binary command. The
lint requires more integration into your project, and currently also needs the
nightly version of Rust for plugin support. Both projects are great for helping
Rust newcomers.</p>
<p>Foreign Function Interface is an area where Rust excels. The absence of a large
runtime means Rust is great for embedding in other languages and it has a wide
range as a C replacement in writing modules for Python, Ruby, Node, etc. The

<p>The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test as implemented works for any data with a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Clone</span></code>
and an <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Ord</span></code> trait implementation in Rust. So it is possible, but pretty
useless, to test samples of characters, strings and lists. In truth, the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test requires the samples to be taken from a continuous
distribution, so discrete data like characters and strings are cute to consider
but invalid test data.</p>
<p>Still being strict, this test condition also does not hold for integer data
unless some hands are waved about the integer data being embedded into
real numbers and a distribution cooked up from the probability weights. We make
some compromises and allowances.</p>
<p>If you have floating point or integer data to test, you can use the included
test runner binaries, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ks_f64</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ks_i32</span></code>. These operate on single-column
headerless data files and test two commandline argument filenames against each
other at 95% confidence.</p>

<p>Testing floating point numbers is a headache because Rust floating point types
(correctly) do not implement the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Ord</span></code> trait, only the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PartialOrd</span></code> trait.
This is because things like <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">NaN</span></code> are not comparable and the order cannot be
total over all values in the datatype.</p>
<p>The test runner for floating point types is implemented using a wrapper type
that implements a total order, crashing on unorderable elements. This suffices
in practice since the unorderable elements will break the test anyway.</p>
<p>The implementation uses the Numerical Recipes approximation for rejection
probabilities rather than the almost as accurate SOEST table approximation for
critical values. This allows the additional reporting of the reject probability
which isn&#8217;t available using the SOEST approach.</p>

<p>Because it is traditional and because it is easy and flexible, start with some
normally distributed data.</p>
<p>Rust can generate normal data using the <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rand/rand/distributions/">rand::distributions</a> module. If
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mean</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">variance</span></code> are <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">f64</span></code> values representing the mean and variance
of the desired normal deviate, then the following code generates the deviate.
Note that the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Normal::new</span></code> call requires the mean and standard deviation as
parameters, so it is necessary to take the square root of the variance to
provide the standard deviation value.</p>

<p>This failure is a demonstration of how the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is sensitive
to location because here the mean of the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dat/normal_0_2.1.tsv</span></code> is shifted
quite far from the origin.</p>
<p>This is the density.</p>
<img alt="_images/n021-1.png" src="_images/n021-1.png" />
<p>And superimposed with the density from <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dat/normal_0_2.tsv</span></code>.</p>
<img alt="_images/n02n021-1.png" src="_images/n02n021-1.png" />
<p>The data for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dat/normal_0_2.1.tsv</span></code> is the taller density in this graph.
Notice, in particular, that the mean is shifted left a lot in comparison with
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dat/normal_0_2.tsv</span></code>. See also the chunks of non-overlapping weight on the
left and right hand slopes.</p>
<p>The difference in means is confirmed by calculation. The dataset for
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dat/normal_0_2.tsv</span></code> has mean 0.001973723, whereas the dataset for
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dat/normal_0_2.1.tsv</span></code> has mean -0.2145779. By comparison, the other
<img class="math" src="_images/math/feefe80143b5bee7f381a2d00ad37e9fc58be311.png" alt="N(0, 2)"/> datasets tests have means -0.1308625, -0.08537648, and
-0.01374325.</p>
<p>Looking at the empirical cumulative density functions of the false negative

</ul>
<p>Note that many of these false positives have rejection probabilities that are
high but fall short of the 95% confidence level required. The null hypothesis is
that the distributions are the same and it is this that must be challenged at
the 95% level.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s examine the test where the rejection probability is lowest, that between
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dat/normal_0_1.2.tsv</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dat/normal_0_2.2.tsv</span></code>.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ cargo run -q --bin ks_f64 dat/normal_0_1.2.tsv dat/normal_0_2.2.tsv

<p>The overlaid density and empirical cumulative density functions show strong
difference.</p>
<img alt="_images/n012n022-1.png" src="_images/n012n022-1.png" />
<img alt="_images/n012n022ecdf-1.png" src="_images/n012n022ecdf-1.png" />
<p>The problem, however, is a lack of samples combined with the weakness of the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in detecting differences in spread at the tails. Both of
these datasets have 256 samples and the critical value for 95% confidence is
0.1186. This is a large difference to demonstrate at the edges of the empirical
cumulative distribution functions and in the case of this test the <img class="math" src="_images/math/9dfa31437b58c0473299320aa638151cd88cf61b.png" alt="D"/>
test statistic is a comfortable 0.082.</p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s also examine the false positive test where the rejection probability is
tied highest, between <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dat/normal_0_1.4.tsv</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dat/normal_0_2.1.tsv</span></code>.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ cargo run -q --bin ks_f64 dat/normal_0_1.4.tsv dat/normal_0_2.1.tsv
Samples are from the same distribution.
test statistic = 0.1171875

<img alt="_images/n014n021ecdf-1.png" src="_images/n014n021ecdf-1.png" />
<p>This is just incredibly borderline. There is a very strong difference on the left
side but it falls fractionally short of the required confidence level. Note how
this also illustrates the bias in favour of the null hypothesis that the two
samples are from the same distribution.</p>
<p>Notice that of the false positives, only the one between
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dat/normal_0_1.2.tsv</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dat/normal_0_2.tsv</span></code> happens with a dataset
containing more than 256 samples. In this test with 8192 samples against 256,
the critical value is 0.0855 and the test statistic scrapes by underneath at
0.08288.</p>
<p>In the case for two samples of size 8192, the critical value is a very
discriminating 0.02118.</p>
<p>In total there are ten false positives in 75 tests, a poor showing.</p>
<p>The lesson is that false positives are more common and especially with small
datasets. When using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in production systems, tend to
use higher confidence levels when larger datasets cannot be available.</p>

<p>Less artificially, and more representative of metrics in software operations and

like response time are very typical and not easy to analyse with usual
statistical technology.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/ab.html">Apache Bench</a> is a commandline URL loadtesting tool that can be used to
collect sample datasets of HTTP request times. A dataset of service times for

<p>The test actually ships 3.36MB of redirect headers since <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">http://twitter.com</span></code>
is a 301 Moved Permanently redirect to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">https://twitter.com</span></code> but the dataset
is still useful as it exhibits the behaviour of HTTP endpoint responses anyway.</p>
<p>The options in the call specify:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-c</span> <span class="pre">1</span></code>: Use test concurrency of one outstanding request to throttle the

<p>A timeout or significant failure can trash the test completely, so it is more
robust to collect data in blocks of 256 requests and combine the results. This

this is why Unix timestamps line up, against sane expectations, on minute

<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ctime</span></code>: Connection time to the server in milliseconds.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dtime</span></code>: Processing time on the server in milliseconds. The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">d</span></code> may stand

<p>The output data is sorted by Apache Bench according to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ttime</span></code>, meaning
shorter requests come first in the output. The purposes here better appreciate
data sorted by the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">seconds</span></code> timestamp, particularly to plot the timeseries
data in the order the requests were issued.</p>
<p>And because nobody is much interested in when exactly this dataset was made, the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">starttime</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">seconds</span></code> fields are dropped from the final data. The
following <a class="reference external" href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/71949">crafty piece of Awk</a> does
the header-retaining sort and column projection.</p>

<p>To transform the headered multi-column data files into a format suitable for

<p>Then to run the test:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre>cargo run -q --bin test_t64 dat/http_ttime.tsv dat/http_ttime.1.tsv
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The timeseries plot shows a common Internet story of outliers, failure cases and
disgrace.</p>
<img alt="_images/http-timeseries-1.png" src="_images/http-timeseries-1.png" />
<p>The density is highly peaked but includes fast failure weight and a long light
tail. This is not straightforward to parametrise with the common statistical
distributions that are fruitful to work with and demonstrates the significant
utility of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.</p>
<img alt="_images/http-density-1.png" src="_images/http-density-1.png" />
<p>Note there is a much larger horizontal axis range in this graph. This has the
effect of compressing the visual area under the graph relative to the earlier
dataset density plots.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let this trick you. The y axis values are smaller than in the other graphs
but there is far more horizontal axis support to compensate. The definition of a
probability density means the area under the graph in all the density plots must
sum to the same.</p>

<p>Here is the timeseries and density plot for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ttime</span></code> in the

<p>There is some similarity to the observations in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dat/http_ttime.tsv</span></code> but there
is a far shorter tail here.</p>
<p>In fact, the datasets are all very different from each other. Here are the other
density plots.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dat/http_ttime.2.tsv</span></code> exhibits a spike of failures which are of short
duration and contribute large weight on the left of the graph.</p>
<img alt="_images/http2-density-1.png" src="_images/http2-density-1.png" />
<p>By contrast <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dat/http_ttime.3.tsv</span></code> has no fast failures or slow outliners and
the weight is packed around .9s to 1s.</p>
<img alt="_images/http3-density-1.png" src="_images/http3-density-1.png" />
<p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dat/http_ttime.4.tsv</span></code> has a long tail for an outlier, likely to be request
timeouts.</p>
<img alt="_images/http4-density-1.png" src="_images/http4-density-1.png" />
<p>By inspection of the empirical cumulative density functions, the only test with
a possible chance of accepting the null hypothesis was that between
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dat/http_ttime.tsv</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dat/http_ttime.4.tsv</span></code>. This is the comparison with
the smallest test statistic from the rejected cases.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ cargo run -q --bin ks_f64 dat/http_ttime.4.tsv dat/http_ttime.tsv

<p>Even still, this is not a close match. The empirical cumulative density function
plots show very different profiles on the error request times to the left of the
diagram.</p>
<img alt="_images/httphttp4ecdf-1.png" src="_images/httphttp4ecdf-1.png" />
<p>As for the passing match, it turns out that <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dat/http_ttime.1.tsv</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dat/http_ttime.4.tsv</span></code> are indeed quite similar. This would be more apparent
but for the outlier in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dat/http_ttime.4.tsv</span></code>. Given that the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is not sensitive at the tails, this does not contribute
evidence to reject the null hypothesis.</p>
<img alt="_images/http1http4ecdf-1.png" src="_images/http1http4ecdf-1.png" />
<p>In conclusion, the captured HTTP response time datasets exhibit features which
make them likely to actually be from different distributions, some with and

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck">QuickCheck</a> is crazy amounts of fun writing tests and a great way to become
comfortable in a new language.</p>
<p>The idea in QuickCheck is to write tests as properties of inputs rather than
specific test cases. So, for instance, rather than checking whether a given
pair of samples have a determined maximum empirical cumulative distribution
function distance, instead a generic property is verified. This property can be
as simple as the distance is between zero and one for any pair of input samples
or as constrictive as the programmer is able to create.</p>
<p>This form of test construction means QuickCheck can probabilistically check the
property over a huge number of test case instances and establish a much greater
confidence of correctness than a single individual test instance could.</p>
<p>It can be harder too, yes. Writing properties that tightly specify the desired
behaviour is difficult but starting with properties that very loosely constrain
the software behaviour is often helpful, facilitating an evolution into more
sharply binding criteria.</p>
<p>For a tutorial introduction to QuickCheck, John Hughes has a great
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi0rHwfiX1Q">introduction talk</a>.</p>
<p>There is an implementation of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/quickcheck">QuickCheck for Rust</a> and the tests for the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov Rust library have been implemented using it. See the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/daithiocrualaoich/kolmogorov_smirnov">Github repository</a>
for examples of how to QuickCheck in Rust.</p>
<p>Here is a toy example of a QuickCheck property to test an integer doubling
function.</p>

<p>This test is broken and QuickCheck makes short(I almost wrote &#8216;quick&#8217;!) work of
letting us know that we have been silly.</p>

<p>The last log line includes the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">u32</span></code> value that failed the test, i.e. zero.
Correct practice is to now create a non-probabilistic test case that tests this
specific value. This protects the codebase from regressions in the future.</p>
<p>The problem in the example is that the property is not actually valid for the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">double</span></code> function because double zero is not actually greater than zero. So
let&#8217;s fix the test.</p>

<p>Note also how QuickCheck produced a minimal test violation, there are no smaller
values of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">u32</span></code> that violated the test. This is not an accident, QuickCheck
libraries often include features for shrinking test failures to minimal
examples. When a test fails, QuickCheck will often rerun it searching
successively on smaller instances of the test arguments to determine the
smallest violating test case.</p>
<p>The function is still broken, by the way, because it overflows for large input
values. The Rust QuickCheck doesn&#8217;t catch this problem because the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">QuickCheck::quickcheck</span></code> convenience runner configures the tester to produce
random data between zero and one hundred, not in the range where the overflow
will be evident. For this reason, you should not use the convenience runner in
testing. Instead, configure the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">QuickCheck</span></code> manually with as large a random
range as you can.</p>

<p>This will break the test with an overflow panic. This is correct and the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">double</span></code> function should be reimplemented to do something about handling
overflow properly.</p>
<p>A warning, though, if you are testing <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">vec</span></code> or string types. The number of
elements in the randomly generated <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">vec</span></code> or equivalently, the length of the
generated string will be between zero and the size in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">StdGen</span></code> configured.
There is the potential in this to create unnecessarily huge <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">vec</span></code> and string
values. See the example of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">NonEmptyVec</span></code> below for a technique to limit the
size of a randomly generated <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">vec</span></code> or string while still using <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">StdGen</span></code> with
a large range.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you are out of luck on a 32-bit machine where the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">usize::MAX</span></code>
will only get you to sampling correctly in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">u32</span></code>. You will need to upgrade to
a new machine before you can test <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">u64</span></code>, sorry.</p>
<p>By way of example, it is actually more convenient to include known failure cases
like <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">u32::max_value()</span></code> in the QuickCheck test function rather than in a
separate traditional test case function. So, when the QuickCheck fails for the
overflow bug, add the test case like follows instead of as a new function:</p>

<p>Sometimes the property to test is not valid on some test arguments, i.e. the
property is useful to verify but there are certain combinations of
probabilistically generated inputs that should be excluded.</p>
<p>The Rust QuickCheck library supports this with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">TestResult</span></code>. Suppose that
instead of writing the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">double</span></code> test property correctly, we wanted to just
exclude the failing cases instead. This might be a practical thing to do in
a real scenario and we can rewrite the test as follows:</p>

</div>
<p>Here, the cases where the property legitimately doesn&#8217;t hold are excluded by
returning``TestResult::discard()``. This causes QuickCheck to retry the test
with the next randomly generated value instead.</p>
<p>Note also that the function return type is now <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">TestResult</span></code> and that
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">TestResult::from_bool</span></code> is needed for the test condition.</p>
<p>An alternative approach is to create a wrapper type in the test code which only
permits valid input and to rewrite the tests to take this type as the
probabilistically generated input instead.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you want to ensure that QuickCheck only generates positive
integers for use in your property verification. You add a wrapper type
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PositiveInteger</span></code> and now in order for QuickCheck to work, you have to
implement the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Arbitrary</span></code> trait for this new type.</p>
<p>The minimum requirement for an <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Arbitrary</span></code> implementation is a function called
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">arbitrary</span></code> taking a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Gen</span></code> random generator and producing a random
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PositiveInteger</span></code>. New implementations should always leverage existing
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Arbitrary</span></code> implementations, and so <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PositiveInteger</span></code> generates a random
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">u64</span></code> using <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">u64::arbitrary()</span></code> and constrains it to be greater than zero.</p>

<p>There is no need now for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">TestResult::discard()</span></code> to ignore the failure case
for zero.</p>
<p>Finally, wrappers can be added for more complicated types too. A commonly
useful container type generator is <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">NonEmptyVec</span></code> which produces a random
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">vec</span></code> of the parameterised type but excludes the empty <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">vec</span></code> case. The
generic type must itself implement <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Arbitrary</span></code> for this to work.</p>
